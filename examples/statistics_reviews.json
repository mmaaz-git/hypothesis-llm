More importantly, the mathematical property being tested (that the mean is always between min and max) should hold exactly for any valid mean calculation, so the additional `math.isclose` checks suggest either: 1) there's a bug in the mean function, or 2) the test is being overly cautious about floating-point precision in a case where it shouldn't be necessary.
