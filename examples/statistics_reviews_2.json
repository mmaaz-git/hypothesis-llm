The falsifying examples show: 1) For data=[0.0, 0.0] with provided_mean=1.0, expected=1.0 but got=2.0 (suggesting division by n-1=1 instead of n=2), and 2) For data=[0.0, very_large_number] with provided_mean=0.0, the function appears to be using a different calculation altogether, possibly the standard sample variance formula rather than variance relative to the provided mean.",

If the function computes sample variance with Bessel's correction, the expected calculation should be: `expected = sum((x - provided_mean) ** 2 for x in data) / (len(data) - 1)`. However, we first need to understand what the `variance` function signature and behavior actually is. If it's the standard library `statistics.variance()`, then it computes sample variance of the data itself (not relative to a provided mean), so the test should be: `expected = sum((x - statistics.mean(data)) ** 2 for x in data) / (len(data) - 1)` and the provided_mean parameter should not be passed to the function.
