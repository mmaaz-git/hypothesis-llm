      "okay": false,
      "issue": "The test fails because it doesn't account for floating-point precision issues when working with large integers. The falsifying example shows constant_value=9_007_199_254_740_993, which is larger than the maximum safe integer in floating-point representation (2^53 - 1 = 9,007,199,254,740,991). When Python's statistics functions perform calculations on such large integers, they may involve floating-point arithmetic internally, leading to precision loss. The mean() function in particular can return a float even when given integers, and for very large integers, this can result in a value that's not exactly equal to the original integer due to floating-point representation limitations.",
      "fix": "Modify the test to handle large integers that may lose precision in floating-point arithmetic. Either: 1) Limit the integer strategy to safe floating-point range: `st.integers(min_value=-(2**53-1), max_value=2**53-1)`, or 2) Use approximate equality for all numeric comparisons regardless of type when dealing with potentially large numbers. The first approach is cleaner: change `st.integers()` to `st.integers(min_value=-(2**53-1), max_value=2**53-1)` in the strategy to ensure all integers can be exactly represented as floats."

      "issue": "The test fails when given an empty string ('') as the constant_value with list_length=2. The issue is that Python's statistics.median() function behaves differently for non-numeric data compared to numeric data. For non-numeric data, median() tries to sort the values and return the middle element(s), but when there are an even number of identical non-numeric elements, it attempts to calculate the average of the two middle elements. Since you can't average non-numeric values like strings, this causes unexpected behavior or errors.
